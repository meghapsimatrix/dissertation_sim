# Simulation for My Dissertation

My dissertation examines cluster wild bootstrapping for handling dependence in meta-analysis The data generation method for this dissertation will follow that of Tipton and Pustejovsky (2015). The design focuses on correlated standardized mean differences (SMDs) for each study. Tipton and Pustejovsky (2015) examined designs resembling intervention studies with multiple continuous measures outcome variables.
