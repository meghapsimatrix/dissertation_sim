# Simulation for My Dissertation

My dissertation examines cluster wild bootstrapping (CWB) for handling dependence in meta-analysis. In the dissertation I compare CWB against a method AHZ proposed by Tipton Pustojevsky (2015) which was shown to have adequate Type 1 error rate but may be very conservative. CWB has been examined in econometrics studies on regression but not in the meta-analytic framework. 

The data generation method for this dissertation will follow that of Tipton and Pustejovsky (2015). The design focuses on correlated standardized mean differences (SMDs) for each study. Tipton and Pustejovsky (2015) examined designs resembling intervention studies with multiple continuous measures outcome variables.  

This sim_tacc folder has functions to generate data, estimate p-values from various method, calculate perforamance criteria and set up the simulation run through.
